					<description><![CDATA[honestly, this comparison with the market leader, FTMO needs a big update.  isn&#039;t myforexfunds done? - as in finished?...i can&#039;t really find them anywhere.
and - it&#039;s good to know what your competitors are doing right &#038; wrong.  it&#039;s a natural outcrop of the survival instinct, that&#039;s healthy in any long-standing business...beware of your competitors in the jungle.
so, i look forward to a serious update...isn&#039;t Sun Tzu? - know your enemy, know yourself, and never be at risk in battle...]]></description>
